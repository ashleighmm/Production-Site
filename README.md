The website development required a YouTube playlist integration within its custom design, multiple categories and interlinking abilities as well as a CMS.
What did I do? I took the WordPress CMS and partially integrated it into a custom-built HTML5 website. This way I got rid of the bulky WordPress clutter and used it for what it is... a great CMS interface. All of the content feeds into, and is styled and structured in the HTML5 website. No WordPress plugins or themes. Just clean code.
